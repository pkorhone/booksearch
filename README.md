# Book Search Front End (React App)

This project was created as a front end for the [Book Search Back End](https://github.com/pkorhone/books-api-springboot). Please see the back end documentation for expected server endpoints.

## Setup:

After cloning this repository, navigate to the root directory and run:
```
npm install
``` 

You will also need to create a file named `.env` to the root directory with the following content to set up your back end URL:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL = {your_server_url_here}
```

You can then run the application by running:
```
npm start
```

On default, the app will run at `http://localhost:3000/`
